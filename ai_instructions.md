# AI Instructions for Solana Wallet Monitor and Trader Project

## Project Overview
You are an AI assistant tasked with implementing the Solana Wallet Monitor and Trader project. This project involves creating a system that monitors Solana wallets, detects new tokens, and executes trades on the Jupiter platform.

## General Instructions

1. Read the entire contents of the instructions.md file in the project root directory before starting implementation.
2. Familiarize yourself with the Solana blockchain, Jupiter trading platform, and other relevant technologies mentioned in the project description.
3. Implement each step in the order presented in the instructions.md file.
4. Use best practices for Python development throughout the project.
5. Regularly commit changes to version control with clear, descriptive commit messages.
6. Ask for clarification if you encounter any ambiguities or need help with a step.
7. Update relevant documentation files as you implement each component.
8. Prioritize security throughout the implementation process.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Process

For each step in the instructions.md file:

1. Read the step description carefully.
2. Plan your implementation approach.
3. Write the necessary code or perform the required actions.
4. Test your implementation to ensure it works as expected.
5. If the step is completed successfully, mark it as done by adding "[DONE]" at the beginning of the step in the instructions.md file.

## Code Quality and Best Practices

1. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
2. Write clear, self-documenting code with appropriate comments where necessary.
3. Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms.
4. Write unit tests for each component you implement.

## Documentation

1. Keep the README.md file up-to-date with an overview of the project, setup instructions, and basic usage guidelines.
2. Update the setup.md file with detailed installation and configuration steps.
3. Maintain the usage.md file with comprehensive instructions on how to use the system.
4. Keep the api_reference.md file updated with details of any APIs or significant functions implemented.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

1. Implement unit tests for individual components.
2. Create integration tests to verify the interaction between different parts of the system.
3. Thoroughly test the testnet simulation before proceeding to mainnet implementation.
4. Perform regular code reviews of your own work, looking for potential improvements or optimizations.

## Security Considerations

1. Handle wallet addresses and private keys securely.
2. Implement secure practices for API interactions, especially with Jupiter.
3. Use encryption for storing sensitive data.
4. Implement rate limiting and other measures to prevent potential attacks.

## Performance Optimization

1. Use efficient data structures for wallet tracking.
2. Implement caching mechanisms where appropriate to reduce redundant API calls.
3. Optimize database queries and data persistence operations.

## Final Review and Reporting

After completing all steps in the instructions.md file:

1. Review the entire project structure and implementation.
2. Ensure all documentation is accurate and up-to-date.
3. Prepare a final report (final_report.md) summarizing:
   - The implementation process
   - Challenges faced and solutions implemented
   - Suggestions for future improvements
   - Security considerations and recommendations

## Continuous Improvement

1. As you work through the implementation, note any potential optimizations or improvements.
2. If you identify better approaches or architectures, document these for future consideration.

Remember, your primary goal is to create a functional, efficient, and secure Solana Wallet Monitor and Trader system. Take your time to ensure each component is implemented correctly and integrates well with the others. Good luck with the implementation!
